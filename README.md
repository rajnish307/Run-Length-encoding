# Run-Length-encoding
Given a string containing uppercase characters (A-Z), compress the string using Run Length encoding. Repetition of character has to be replaced by storing the length of that run.  Write a python function which performs the run length encoding for a given String and returns the run length encoded String.  Provide different String values and test your program.
